Hi, Iâ€™m @Daandamhuis ðŸ‘‹

Currently working at stichd (a PUMA company) as a Business Intelligence Consultant specializing in all things data in the Microsoft Stack.

In my spare time I've started working on [PyTabular](https://github.com/Curts0/PyTabular). My goal for PyTabular is to make it easier to create documentation for Power BI and Analysis Server models based on the meta-data that is already there in the definition.
